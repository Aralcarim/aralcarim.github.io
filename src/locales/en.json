        "p1": "It all started on a crisp autumn evening in Prague. Vaclav was rushing to a tech conference, and Cinzia was admiring the architecture near the Charles Bridge. Usually, paths like theirs don't cross—one focused on code, the other on art—but destiny has a funny way of bringing people together.",
        "p2": "A shared coffee at a riverside cafe turned into hours of conversation about everything from quantum computing to Italian Renaissance art. They realized that despite their different backgrounds, they shared the same values, the same love for adventure, and the same dream of building a beautiful life together.",
        "p3": "Five years, countless travels, and one beautiful proposal in Venice later, here we are. We can't wait to start our next chapter with all of you by our side."
